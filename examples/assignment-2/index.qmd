title: "Assignment 2: Quality Control for AI-Generated Content"
---

Candidates design a system for evaluating and improving AI-generated flashcard quality
They should present methods for quality assessment, automated evaluation, and improvement
Focus is on defining quality criteria, implementing quality metrics, and validating educational value
Uses the same Python code as a starting point
Tests technical depth, systematic thinking, and understanding of educational assessment

## Overview
Your task is to design and present a system for evaluating and improving the quality of AI-generated flashcards. You will present your concept to the hiring committee in a 30-minute presentation, followed by 10 minutes of discussion.



## Context
The provided Python script (generate-anki-deck.py) creates Anki flashcards from teaching materials using the OpenAI API. While the system generates flashcards efficiently, ensuring their educational quality and accuracy is crucial for effective learning.

## Your Task
Design and present a systematic approach for:

- Evaluating the quality of AI-generated flashcards
- Implementing automated quality control measures
- Improving the generation process based on quality metrics

## Instructions
1. Read the [instructions](assignments/index.qmd) for the assignment.
2. Download the {{<bi file-code >}} [anki-deck-generator.zip](assets/anki-deck-generator.zip) and unzip it.
3. Follow the instructions in the code to run the Anki flashcard generator.
4. Write a 30-minute presentation of your workshop concept.
5. Present your workshop concept to the class.


Present your concept for a 3-hour workshop, including structure, teaching methods, and hands-on exercises

## Notes
- The current code is a starting point---there are many edge cases that are not handled.
- Feel free to make suggestions on how to improve the code.
- Consider that participants may not have much (or indeed any) experience with Python.

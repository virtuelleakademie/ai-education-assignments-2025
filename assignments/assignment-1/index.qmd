title: "Assignment 1: Teaching AI Development Workshop"
---

## Overview
Your task is to demonstrate how you would teach lecturers to create an AI-powered Anki flashcard generator using an LLM. You will give a 30-minute presentation of your workshop concept.

## Context
Many university lecturers are interested in leveraging AI to enhance their teaching but may lack the technical knowledge to develop their own tools. You have been provided with example code ({{<bi file-code >}} [anki-deck-generator.zip](assets/anki-deck-generator.zip)) that creates Anki flashcards from teaching materials using the OpenAI API.

## Instructions
1. Read the [instructions](assignments/index.qmd) for the assignment.
2. Download the {{<bi file-code >}} [anki-deck-generator.zip](assets/anki-deck-generator.zip) and unzip it.
3. Follow the instructions in the code to run the Anki flashcard generator.
4. Write a 30-minute presentation of your workshop concept.
5. Present your workshop concept to the class.


Present your concept for a 3-hour workshop, including structure, teaching methods, and hands-on exercises.

## Notes
- The current code is a starting point---there are many edge cases that are not handled.
- Feel free to make suggestions on how to improve the code.
- Consider that participants may not have much (or indeed any) experience with Python.

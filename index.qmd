# Welcome to Round 2

We look forward to seeing your innovative approach to integrating AI technology in higher education. In your role as an AI Expert at our university, you will be instrumental in educating lecturers on AI applications for teaching and helping develop AI-powered educational tools.

## Your Task

For this round, you will:

1. Choose **one** of the two assignments detailed below
2. Prepare and deliver a 20-minute presentation

Both assignments involve working with the OpenAI API to generate Anki flashcards using structured output. Before reviewing the assignments, we recommend reading the background information about Anki flashcards.

:::{.callout-note title="Background: Anki Flashcards" collapse=true}

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a powerful open-source flashcard program that uses the principles of spaced repetition and active recall to enhance learning and long-term retention. It presents flashcards at optimal intervals, adjusting the frequency of review based on the user's performance. This is thought to ensure that information is reinforced before it is forgotten.

One of the key strengths of Anki is its flexibility. Users can create their own decks of flashcards tailored to their specific learning needs, or they can download pre-made decks from shared repositories covering a vast array of subjects, from languages and vocabulary to complex medical terminology.

However, Anki requires a lot of manual work to create effective flashcards. In this assignment, we will explore how we can use an LLM to generate the flashcards for us.


### Flashcards
The simplest type of Anki flashcard is a pair of text fields: a **question** and an **answer** (or a *term* and a *definition*).

Anki can import flashcards from a variety of formats, including comma-separated values (CSV) files. A CSV file is a text file that uses a delimiter, e.g. a comma, to separate columns. Each line of the file is a row, and each row has of one or more columns.

If we have the following list of terms and definitions:

| term | definition |
|------|------------|
| Metacognition | "The ability to think about one's own thinking processes" |
| Self-Regulated Learning | "The process of taking control of and evaluating one's own learning" |
| Executive Functions | "Higher-order cognitive processes like working memory and cognitive flexibility" |
| Scaffolding | "Support provided by teachers or peers to help students learn new skills" |

we can save these in a CSV file:

```
term,definition
Metacognition,"The ability to think about one's own thinking processes"
Self-Regulated Learning,"The process of taking control of and evaluating one's own learning"
Executive Functions,"Higher-order cognitive processes like working memory and cognitive flexibility"
Scaffolding,"Support provided by teachers or peers to help students learn new skills"
```


If we save the contents above in to a file, we can import them into Anki by selecting the `File -> Import...` menu item.

:::{.caution title="Important" collapse=true}

We do not expect you to present or explain code during your presentation. Instead, your presentation should focus on:

- Your conceptual approach to teaching AI development
- Your educational philosophy and teaching methods
- A thoughtful discussion of the possibilities and limitations of using AI in education
- Your strategies for making technical concepts accessible to non-technical audiences

The provided code and materials are meant to help you understand the technical foundation, but your presentation should focus on the bigger picture of effectively teaching and implementing AI tools in higher education.
